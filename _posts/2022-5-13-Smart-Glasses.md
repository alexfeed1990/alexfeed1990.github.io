title: Smart glasses? ...
---

I've been interested in giving birth to this project for a while. And yes I did try to phrase that wierdly.
Smart glasses, I have always wanted to make smart glasses. Especially ones that look good. Not like the big pieces of chonk that you see in youtube DIY tutorials.

Seriously, look it up.

I don't want my glasses to be big pieces of chonk, so I'm gonna put the RPI on the left of the glasses and the screen on the right.

Talking about the screen, I have seen smart glasses that literally have transparent oled's sticked to the lenses, but it becomes a big blur super fast.
So I've figured a screen that's a bit away from the lens is much better.

So, here's the concept:

Let me give you a close up:

Yes I did model that in roblox studio, I'm too dumb to use blender/CAD.
But you get it.


Now, let me address the elephant in the room. I do not know how to solder, or how to wire the screen up to the GPIO pins.

Basically I know nothing about how it's gonna work.
I did find a nice library for oled's with python. It's called [luma](https://github.com/rm-hull/luma.oled)
So I do know a little, but not much.

But what I do know is how I'm gonna basically build it.

So what do you think? If you have any questions or ideas/suggestions on the project, shoot me a DM on discord (Slashed.#0698). 
And that's about it! Hope you have a good rest of your week. Logging off.
