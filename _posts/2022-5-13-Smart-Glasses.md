title: Smart glasses? ...
---

I've been interested in giving birth to this project for a while. And yes I did try to phrase that wierdly.
Smart glasses, I have always wanted to make smart glasses. Especially ones that look good. Not like the big pieces of chonk that you see in youtube DIY tutorials.

Seriously, look it up.

I don't want my glasses to be big pieces of chonk, so I'm gonna put the RPI on the left of the glasses and the screen on the right.

Talking about the screen, I have seen smart glasses that literally have transparent oled's sticked to the lenses, but it becomes a big blur super fast.
So I've figured a screen that's a bit away from the lens is much better.
