title: Update on the smart glasses!
---

Hi, saying that I will write a blog in next week was kinda dumb, because here I am. Like two months later.

Anyways, I posted my original blog on a tech server. And a person said it would be ridiculous to run a RPI on a battery like that.
I was going for looks anyways, and stacking a RPI on top of a battery wouldn't be the safest or slimmest option.

So they reccomended me a microcontroller! It's a "Seeed XIAO BLE nRF52840 Sense - TinyML/TensorFlow Lite- IMU / Microphone - Bluetooth5". And yes, I copy pasted the name.

Basically it can run TensorFlow/TinyML which is super nice if I would wanna do manual voice recognition and not use google speech to text or something like that. But I would probably go for the second option.
And it has Bluetooth! (yay) And a microphone. I will probably do calls or something if I could fit speakers in there. Maybe actual headphones that are embedded in the smart glasses for stability.

That's cool and all, but I still have no idea what I will do for the software. I know this microcontroller can run circuitpython, which is a G I A N T skip ahead and will help me a SHIT ton.
But otherwise, I don't really know what to say. That's all I got. Cya.
